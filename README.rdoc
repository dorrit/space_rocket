WHAT IS IT?
This is a social networking app for small groups. I am specifically designing it for the 50-unit apartment building that I live in. Because we live in a culture where it is difficult for people to meet each other, I wanted to create a venue for neighbors to get to know something about each other so that they would be more likely to start conversations when they bump into someone in the hallways or laundry room.

FEATURES
* Users can create a profile, read about their neighbors, let people know that they have stuff they are getting rid of.
* Admin (building manager) can post group notices about things like cigarette butts on the fire escape, or emergency preparedness
*General Public - can view pictures and information about the historic building.
